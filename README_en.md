# <center>tstroncli</center>

![](./summary.png)

A command-line interface (CLI) tool built with Node.js and TypeScript for interacting with the TRON blockchain.

This project aims to provide a simple and extensible framework that allows developers to easily call TRON's HTTP API from the command line to perform operations such as querying on-chain information and sending transactions.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Interactive Command Line**: Provides a persistent interactive prompt in the terminal.
- **Clear Architecture**: Separation of command logic, definitions, and the main program for easy understanding and maintenance.
- **Easy to Extend**: Adding new commands only requires modifying one file without changing the core logic.
- **TypeScript Support**: Complete type definitions for a better development experience and code robustness.
- **Elegant Output**: Uses `chalk` and `figlet` to beautify the output, and `console.table` to format help messages.

## The project is still under development, and more commands are yet to be added. Contributions are welcome!

### Development Process

1.  **Create a command function**:

    - In the relevant file under the `src/` directory (e.g., account-related commands are in `src/account.ts`), create a new `async` function.
    - This function will receive a `tronWeb` instance and any number of arguments.

2.  **Register the new command**:
    - Open the `src/commands.ts` file.
    - Import your function from the file where you created it.
    - In the `commands` Map, use `commands.set()` to add your new command, providing the command name, description, and your function.

Now you can recompile and run the project, and your new command should appear in the `/help` list.
